# Signatures Repo

The idea is to produce a standalone executable, or plugin for documents that allows the writing of a signature using the webcam and drawing with a finger.

## How to use

Run drawWithFinger.py or fingerSign.py
    
    ```
    python drawWithFinger.py
    ```
    
    ```
    python fingerSign.py
    ```


Draw with index finger, turn off pen by closing fist, turn on pen by opening fist.

When done press 'q' or cmd + q to quit.
press 's' to save the image to the downloads folder.
